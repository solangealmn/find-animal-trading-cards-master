			<p><span class="text-italic">At birth, wolf pups tend to have darker fur and their eyes have blue irises that will change to a yellow-gold or orange colour when the pups are between 8 and 16 weeks old. Though extremely unusual, it is possible for an adult wolf to retain its blue-coloured irises.</span></p>

			<p>No other wolf in the world can offer the same coloring as the Arctic Wolf. While some species of wolves do have some white coloring, this one is almost completely white. Some of them only weight about 75 pounds. Others though can weigh up to 125. Around
				Alaska the natural habitat for these wolves has been untouchable due to the land being too cold for people to thrive in.</p>
